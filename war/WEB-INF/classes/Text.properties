# About This Page
aboutSiteHeading=About This Site
aboutSitePara1=EZ Sched is a free online shift scheduler. Use it to create and share schedules.
#aboutSitePara2=As background, I created this application because I wanted to gain experience with database design. My friend Jeff Hansen suggested I write a shift scheduler because he wanted one when he worked at a coffee house. I thought it was a good suggestion because it required the storage and retrieval of several different types of data such as users and shifts.
#aboutSitePara3=After logging in, a store can be created or selected. For each store, there are two types of users: administrators and regular users. Administrators have access to all functionality, while regular users have limited access.

# Help
helpQ1=How do users of my store login? First, they need to have a Google account. Second, their primary Google account e-mail address (usually their GMail address) needs to be the e-mail address of their user information.  See the Users page after signing in.
helpQ2=How can a schedule show time off?  Create a role called 'Time Off'.  If all users can update their own time off, set 'All User Update Access' for this role to yes.
helpQ3=Does this site work with mobile browsers?  This site works with all browsers.  However, if the screen size is small and the rows on the Schedule page are wrapping, decrease the 'Days in Display' until this does not occur.
