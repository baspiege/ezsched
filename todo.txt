MED

LOW
- daily sched which is ordered by time, start shift
- trim down size of sched page
- remove invalid characters when redisplay
- for user, add option to only see shifts for themselves (admin controlled)
- add cancel to edit shift
- if create entry in past, give message
- add role name to edit message when shift already exists and to success message
- user delete, when showing shifts, only from current time forward?
- add info about time off to role? For example, if all users call update shifts of the role Time Off, set this to Yes.
- if default role or shift deleted, default to no role on user shift or user edit (issue anymore)
- when setting current user, get users from memcache and spin through that list? no, won't scale if lots of users.
- cache stores when doing store get all.
- check if more than 24hrs since last accessed store from cache and update datastore
- spanish - test edit messages, request fields
- usershiftdelete using list so user check is not done everytime
- shifts - table. sort columns.  each column has hidden sort value.  or sort on server?
- when selecting row or col, if deselect one of the items, remove checkbox from select row/col.  but then when clicked again, would remove all.  so confusing.
    - maybe checkbox is S button.  when clicked selects.  then changes to U.
- drag and drop - security tests on server.
    - indicator when posting.  spinning cursor?
    - xmlhttprequest?  or move into cell.  but then have to sort...
    - if not xmlhttprequest, scroll back to position if no edits?
- if selected spanish, pass through login and logoff.
